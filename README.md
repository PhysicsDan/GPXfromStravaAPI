# GPXfromStravaAPI
Create GPX files from datastreams downloaded using the Strava API

DISCLAIMER: I am a hobbiest so this may not be the 'best' way to do the following but it has worked well for me.

The StravaAPI doesn't allow for direct downloading of GPX files. Therefore individual latitude, longitude and elevation values are downloaded and then converted into a gpx file using the `gpxpy.gpx` module.

Note: The GPX files produced could be used in this [code by Remi Salmon](https://github.com/remisalmon/Strava-local-heatmap) which generates a heatmap of the activities (and looks class!).

Currently the limitations are the GPX file will only contain latitude, longitude, time and elevation, not heartrate although that is easy enough to add but was not required by me.

## Setting up the API
There is a handy guide [here](https://medium.com/swlh/using-python-to-connect-to-stravas-api-and-analyse-your-activities-dummies-guide-5f49727aac86) that shows you how to set up an Strava so you can make API requests. 

The main information and actions you require are:
- In the `keys` directory, please delete the file `strava_tokens.json` if it exists as this will be generated on the initial successful run with the relevant information returned from Strava
- User Code (numeric, Shown in the API section of Strava settings as `Client ID`)
- Secret Code (GUID, Shown in the API section of Strava settings as `Client Secret`)
- Authentication Token (GUID, see the [linked guide](https://medium.com/swlh/using-python-to-connect-to-stravas-api-and-analyse-your-activities-dummies-guide-5f49727aac86) on how to obtain this from the returned URL)

You will need to add this info to the `client_info.json file` in the `keys` folder. After that when you run the code for the first time it should generate the relavent tokens etc that are required.

If the inital requests fails, you need to commence this process from the start.


Requirements: see requirements.txt

## Usage:
```
python main.py
```

You can also use:
```
python main.py --dir /path/to/directory
```
if the python file and folders etc are in a different directory

You can also specify the location of where you want to store your data and api keys relative to the working directory
```
python main.py --keys path/to/api/keys --data path/to/data/folder
```

Limitations:
There is a limit to the number of API requests a user can make (per 15 mins and per day). This code is set up in such a way that it should stop once that limit has been reached to avoid pointless requests. However, this does mean in can take several days to fully download a users GPX files for the first time.

If you have any issues feel free to open a discussion and I can try and help :)
